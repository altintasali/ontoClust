<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This packages clusters gene ontology terms. Currently supported gene ontology databases are 
    Gene Ontology (GO): Biological Process (BP), Molecular Function (MF), Cellular Component (CC);
    Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG): KEGG and KEGG Modules;
    REACTOME;
    Disease Ontology (DO).
    

## Installation

Please install `devtools` if you haven't yet.
```r
install.packages("devtools")
```

Then, you basically install the `ontoClust` package by using:
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("altintasali/ontoClust")
```

## Quick Start

For a quick start, I recommend checking the example code provided in the vignette:

```r 
library(ontoClust)
vignette(topic = "quickstart", package = "ontoClust")
```
